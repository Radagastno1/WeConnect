# WeConnect
This project aims to transform a previous console app project, "Facebook-Lite," 
which was developed during a database course last year, into an MVC application called "WeConnect." 
The goal is to provide a web-based platform for social networking with additional features and functionalities.

Teachings:
- I had way to much functionality being decided in UI that should have been in LOGIC. That makes it difficult trying to figure out what things need to work together eg.
- Some methods name are confusing. Takes time just to figure out which method to call.
- Functions that need to always be together aren't always together, can make the application inconsistent.
